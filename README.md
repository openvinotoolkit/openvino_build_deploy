Welcome to the **Build and Deploy AI Solutions** repository! This repository contains pre-built components and code samples designed to accelerate the development and deployment of **production-grade AI** applications across various industries, including retail, healthcare, gaming, manufacturing, and more. With the OpenVINO™ Toolkit from Intel, you can enhance the capabilities of both Intel and non-Intel hardware to meet your specific needs.

> Material and dependencies are self-contained, so you can get started building easily.

If you're looking for code samples or tutorials: You can find tutorial-based content at the [OpenVINO Notebooks]() repository, and hands-on Gen AI samples for Python and C++ at the OpenVINO.GenAI repository (see Additional Resources for more information).

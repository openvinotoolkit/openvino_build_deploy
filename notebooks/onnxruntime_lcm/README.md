# Image generation using Latent Consistency Model and ONNX Runtime with OpenVINO Execution Provider 

LCMs: The next generation of generative models after Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs). 
Latent Diffusion models (LDMs) have achieved remarkable results in synthesizing high-resolution images. However, the iterative sampling is computationally intensive and leads to slow generation.

### Notebook Contents

This notebook demonstrates how to  run [LCM_Dreamshaper_v7](https://huggingface.co/SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7) using ONNX Runtime and OpenVINO Execution Provider on iGPU of AI PC. This demo requires Python 3.10 or 3.11 for Windows.

## Installation Instructions
- Create a virtual environment using 
  ```sh  
  python -m venv <venv-name>
  ```
- To activate the virtual environment use
  ```sh
  \<venv-name>\Scripts\activate
  ```
- Install the Packages
  ```sh
  python -m pip install --upgrade pip 
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
- Now you only need a Jupyter server to start.
- All other dependencies are installed in the notebook itself
